# Syncing mods

To sync the mods with the ones that are written in the manifest.json, run the `syncmods.bat` (Windows) or `syncmods.sh` (Linux/MacOS) script.

# Syncing overrides

To copy the overrides you changed to the pax/modpack/overrides folder, run the `sync_overrides.bat` (Windows) or `sync_overrides.sh` (Linux/MacOS) script.

**Notice:** Everything else than mods and resource packs is an override. (For example configs, scripts, resources.)

## Pax usage

Use pax using cmd or terminal.
